# 🚨  Alarm management  🚨

Management of the 23 alarms that JK-BMS can trigger.
See DOCS.md file for more information

The module will create sensors automatically in HAOS.
These are:

- ❶ `binary_sensor.bms_x_bms_alarm_active`
- ❷ `sensor.bms_1_bms_1_alarm_list`

These 2 sensors indicate on which BMS there is an alarm and the wording of these alarms. If there is more than one, they are separated by a comma.

A global sensor:

- ❸ `binary_sensor.bms_global_bms_global_alarm`
This is a binary sensor that enables simple automation in the event of an alarm on any BMS.

It was a big, long job, but I think it was worth it.
You tell me.

## 3.1.2

 🐞 Bug fixes --> Incorrect min / max ranges for MQTT number entities

[Issue #29](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/29)

All Home Assistant entities now have appropriate scales.

###  📌 For this to be taken into account !!!
it is **essential to Delete the MQTT device** `BMS_1, BMS_2, BMS_3, etc.`

So that the entities can be recreated with the correct value scales


## 3.1.1

 🐞 Bug fixes

Changed base image amd64 home assistant addon from 'stable' to '18.1.0'.
due to a change in the 'stable' image


## 3.1

## ⚡️ Enhancements

##           🌟  Cloud MQTT Broker support  🌟

Enable secure, encrypted transmission of user-defined JK-BMS entities to a cloud broker such as HiveMQTT.

As a result, this data can be accessed anywhere in the world and on any device that has an MQTT client installed.

For example, on your phone, the ["IoT MQTT Panel"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod&hl=en-US) application lets you connect to the Cloud Broker and display the JK-BMS values on your phone in a dashboard defined by you or downloaded from my Ko-Fi.

There's no need to install anything else at home, such as VPNs, proxies (Nginx) or personal plug&play networks like Zerotier or Tailscale.

## To select the entities you wish to export
use the "File editor" addon to modify the `configentities_list.json` file

For a fuller description, You can read the [`HiveMQ-Access.md` ](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/HiveMQ-Access.md)on the Github

You can also watch the video explanation on my channel Youtube: [@domosimple](https://www.youtube.com/@domosimple)
## Translations

Fields descriptions in the module configuration automatically take into account the English or French language 😃

## ⚠️ Please, Save your module settings
As the format has changed. You will then need to fill it in again ‼️ ‼️

**Please** also, click on the **"Reset to default"** button on the configuration menu. This will clean up the configuration file and you will be able to define it again with your settings

## 3.0.12

## ⚡️ Enhancements

It is now possible to have the debug option on both the rs485 port and the IP gateway.

⚠️ The `gateway_debug` parameter no longer exists, replaced by `communication_debug`

👀 Please, Don't forget to reset it to "false" once testing is complete. This could unnecessarily overload the module

## 3.0.8

## 🐞 Bug fixes
following the enlightened suggestion of https://github.com/lgrenetier
I have changed "node-red-dashboard": "*", to "node-red-dashboard": "3.6.3"
so that the module can be installed

## 3.0.7
change a timer for the MQTT alive

## 3.0.6

## 🐞 Bug fixes

- Check that MQTT is communicating with the module
I have created a Topic in the MQTT broker to confirm that the module is able to talk to the broker at. This Topic is called **JK-BMS-RS485-CAN-module** and it must be equal to **"Online"**.
You can check this with MQTTExplorer
<img width="680" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca40210b-f563-45c8-a73f-43a67e05cb32" />


- Checking communication with the BMS:
To check that communication with the BMS is working properly, a log is created in the module's log file. Every 30 seconds you should be able to see this type of text

```
6 Aug 18:42:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:42:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
6 Aug 18:43:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:43:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
```

## 3.0.5

## ⚡️ Enhancements

- Code change for "static" & "setup" frames.
Auto-discovery sent once on module start-up.

Then only the data is sent.
This loads the MQTT broker 10x less. The acquisition time is now set at 4 seconds for 2 BMS.

- Add new topic named **BMS_1/cell_voltage_min_number** which gives the voltage of the lowest cell in the pack



## 3.0.4
Change pickup time

## 3.0.3
Init flow variable

## 3.0.2

## 🐞 Bug fixes
No longer send auto-discovery topics with data frames. Send them just once at startup.
This will relieve the MQTT broker and improve the speed of data updates in HAOS.
This loads the MQTT broker 500x less

## 3.0.1

## ⚡️ Enhancements

**SETUP fields**

Defining the various boudary values for the BMS  **setup** variable

For the various variables, I now define realistic **min** and **max** limits, as well as the **increment/decrement step** and, if necessary, its unit.

Added documentation on RS485 & CAN protocols for jkbms


## 2.0.0

## ⚡️ Enhancements
Here is the add-on's new functionality in Version 2.0

It is now possible to leave a BMS in Master mode.

This involves setting all 4 small switches to the **down** or **0000** position.
Parameters can no longer be modified in this mode !

In this configuration, the BMS will query the other BMSs if any are connected to the RS485 bus.

The BMS will then broadcast the information it has retrieved cyclically every 5 seconds. This information will be read by this add-on

## 📚 Documentation

Please read the Github [README.md](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/README.md)
