## 4.2.79

- Preserve the manually reorganized Premium dashboard flow from flows(164).json.
- Restore grid card visibility at low or zero power when a grid sensor is configured or detected; retain the 20 W animation threshold.
- Restore explanatory messages on the three BMS 1 Node-RED pages when no data is available. These pages still require Legacy Active Polling.
- Remove three dangling link references and restore the original non-Premium dispatch order through link nodes.
- Preserve Legacy communication, LCD/heating controls and Active Polling Multi-Pack logic.

## 4.2.78 DEV — 2026-09-24

### Fixed
- Keep Premium grid cards visible at low or zero power when a grid power or energy sensor is configured or detected. The existing 20 W threshold now only controls the flow animation in this case.
- Show an explanatory message on the three BMS 1 Node-RED pages when no data has been received, including their limitation to Legacy Active Polling. Broadcasting and Multi-Pack acquisition are not connected to these pages.

### Scope
- No changes to BMS acquisition, LCD/heating commands, MQTT topics, or flow wiring and positions.

## 4.2.77 DEV — 2026-09-21
## 4.2.76 DEV — 2026-09-21 
Fixed
Prevented dashboard cleanup from targeting the Legacy dashboard when the Multi-Pack dashboard file is missing, on both HAOS and standalone Docker.
Fixed dropped Legacy TCP commands by queuing requests instead of discarding them.
Fixed post-command SETUP reads to target the correct BMS without advancing the periodic polling counter.
Fixed LCD switch state decoding and Home Assistant feedback.
Fixed dashboard language selection being overridden by an older browser preference.
Fixed partial translations such as “Audayd’hui”.
Masked Premium keys and other sensitive options in standalone Docker startup logs.
Removed invalid Node-RED Link references and corrected group membership.
Improved
Added dashboard synchronization result and exit-code logging.
Reorganized the flows visually and replaced selected long wires with Link nodes.
Retained timestamped TCP/USB captures for diagnostics.
Validation
LCD OFF/ON and heating controls tested successfully on two BMS in Legacy TCP mode.
Dashboard fixes passed local tests; Docker restart validation remains pending.

## 4.2.75 DEV — 2026-09-22 Cleanup flows display
## 4.2.74 DEV — 2026-09-21 Cleanup flows display

## 4.2.73 DEV — Active Polling multi-pack TCP (experimental)

- Explicit opt-in `multi_pack_active_polling`; defaults OFF. Requires TCP packs
  with explicit `bms_addresses`, broadcasting OFF and CAN OFF.
- Independent TCP request queues per pack, CRC/checksum/address validation,
  reconnect after timeout to discard late replies.
- Existing optimized multi-pack LIVE processing and aggregates reused.
- LCD and heating controls: fresh read/modify/write/readback on the same BMS;
  authorization required; retained commands rejected; no optimistic state.
- Other parameters are read-only in this first Active Polling stage.
- Legacy function bodies and Broadcasting parser unchanged. Physical transport
  guards are identity functions when the new opt-in is OFF.
- HAOS integration first; standalone and multi-pack serial not enabled here.

> ⚠️ **Development test release — not yet recommended for production installations.**
## 4.2.72 - 2026-09-18 (test candidate)

- Fix balance trigger voltage validation: accept 0.003–1 V, matching the existing
  MQTT discovery bounds, including 0.010 and 0.020 V. Encode millivolts as before.
- Align balance starting voltage validation with the published 1.2–4.25 V bounds.
- Stop invalid balance commands instead of forwarding the original payload.
  Validate numeric/boolean inputs and take the target address from the command.
- Remove optimistic command-state publication. SETUP readback supplies actual
  states; balance commands use regular polling without an extra unaddressed read.
- Block error-bearing/non-Buffer messages at the common parameter-write gate.
- Preserve existing balance-switch authorization exception and all MQTT identities.
  Heating logic and Broadcasting/Multi-Pack flows are unchanged from 4.2.71.
- Software tests passed; real BMS validation still required. This does not claim
  to resolve the unconfirmed device-page display discrepancy from issue #177.

## 4.2.71 - 2026-09-17 (test candidate)

- Subscribe to Legacy MQTT control topics after configuration has loaded; restore
  subscriptions on MQTT connection. Block commands outside Legacy Active Polling.
- Add the `heating_switch` Home Assistant entity (HeatEN, register `0x1114`, bit 0).
  Wait for the next addressed SETUP poll before writing; confirm from a subsequent
  SETUP, without publishing an optimistic state or changing polling intervals.
- Respect modification authorization; reject retained heating commands and expire
  unconfirmed intents. Pending commands are cleared on restart/reconfiguration.
- Preserve unrelated register bits in PCL, Smart Sleep and Timed Stored Data
  writes. Correct their SETUP bit offsets and the Floating Mode bit offset.
- Preserve all existing entity identities and the separate live heating sensor.
  Broadcasting and multi-pack transport flows are unchanged.
- Software regression tests included; real BMS/HAOS validation is still required.

## 4.2.70 - 2026-09-16
Correction to the “Standalone Docker” message. Under HAOS, 
it will now display your current address as follows:

HAOS add-on dashboard URL (detected LAN interface):
http://192.168.0.217:1891/endpoint/dashboard/


## 4.2.69 - 2026-09-14

### 🚀 Multi-Pack Broadcasting — up to 80 BMS

- Up to **5 independent RS485 packs × 16 JK-BMS = 80 BMS maximum** per add-on instance.
- Each pack can independently use TCP/IP or USB/RS485; mixed transport layouts are supported.
- Multi-Pack is recommended for new Broadcasting installations, even with only one pack.
- Stable `pack_1`…`pack_5` identities with isolated MQTT/HA data, Health and aggregation.
- Premium Multi-Pack Overview, per-pack/BMS pages and advanced diagnostics.
- Legacy Broadcasting and Legacy Active Polling remain fully supported for existing installations.
- Backward-compatible migration from earlier Multi-Pack configuration files.
- Legacy dashboards are removed in Multi-Pack and recreated automatically when returning to Legacy.
- Lab validation: **5 packs / 12 BMS** with mixed TCP + real USB; 80 BMS is the supported architecture limit.
- Multi-Pack Active Polling is planned for a future release.

### 📦 Changelog – RS485 Polling Interval (non-broadcast mode)

## ✨ New Feature

* Added a new configuration option:
` non\\\_broadcasting\\\_data\\\_interval\\\_s`

This allows users to control the polling interval for data interval when broadcasting mode is disabled.



|🚀 Behavior Summary||
|-|-|
|Mode|Behavior|
|Broadcasting ON|No change|
|Broadcasting OFF|Data interval = user-defined|

⚠️ Notes

* Minimum supported value: 1 seconds
* Maximum supported value: 30 seconds
* Default value: 1 second
Uses dynamic scheduling instead of fixed inject → more flexible \& scalable

💡 Why this change

* Avoid hardcoded polling intervals
* Improve performance tuning depending on:   **number of BMS on the RS485 Bus**
* network latency (TCP / RS485 gateway)
* system load (HAOS / Node-RED)

## v3.5.5 - 28-01-2026

## ⚡️ Enhancements

### Add Charging Float Mode" switch control

* Charging Float Mode on a JK-BMS is used to manage a float charge once the battery is full.

👉 In concrete terms:

* When the target end-of-charge voltage is reached,
* the BMS cuts off and then temporarily re-authorises charging to maintain the battery at a stable voltage,
* instead of leaving it constantly on charge..

🎯 Main objective:

* avoid overload,
* reduce cell stress,
* improve battery life (especially when stationary).

#### Addition of an Authorization/Prohibition Switch entity to modify settings

In the Global BMS device, this switch:

* switch.bms\_global\_authorize\_modify\_settings (ON / OFF)

enables/disables the ability to modify BMS settings.

This is to prevent unwanted and unintended modifications.
This entity acts on all BMS devices.

## v3.5.3 - 16-01-2026

## ⚡️ Enhancements

#### Optimisation of the number of alarm messages sent per second

**BEFORE** Over 60 seconds with 2 BMS:  
*30 messages / 60s = 0.5 msg/s EVEN IF NOTHING CHANGES*



**AFTER** optimisation Over 60 seconds with 2 BMS (normal scenario, no alarms):
*2 messages / 60s = 0.03 msg/s   Reduction: ÷ 15! (from 30 to 2 messages)*

If an alarm appears on a BMS:

*Timeline:
Overall status OFF → 0 messages
BMS\_2 alarm ON → Aggregation detects: OFF → ON → 1 message 🚨
Status remains ON   → 0 messages
BMS\_2 alarm OFF → Aggregation detects: ON → OFF → 1 message ✅*

\##📈 **TOTAL summary** with all optimisations in versions **v3.5.2 \& v3.5.3**

## Final result: **75 msg/s → \~33.5 msg/s (÷ 2.2)** 🎉

The Broker will appreciate this 💪 .
This will be even more noticeable as the number of BMSs increases.

\##Other changes.

Filters added for invalid BMS numbers. Only the following should remain:
BMS\_master, BMS\_1 to BMS\_15

<img width="389" height="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6975e234-4126-4221-8713-fa07c81c9d4b" />

## v3.5.2 - 15-01-2026

## ⚡️ Enhancements

#### Optimisation of the number of topics sent to the MQTT Broker

Indeed, for 2 BMS measured over 60 seconds:

📊 **Before and after comparison**

|Metric|BEFORE (Non-optimised setup)|AFTER Phase 1 (Optimised setup)|Gain|
|-|-|-|-|
|Messages total/60s|\~4600|2000|-57%|
|Overall average|75-77 msg/s|33.67 msg/s|÷ 2.3|
|BMS\_master|39 msg/s|17 msg/s|÷ 2.3|
|BMS\_2|37 msg/s|16.66 msg/s|÷ 2.2|

I have reduced the number of setup frames sent.
They are now only sent when the module starts up and when a setup is modified.

### This results in a **2.3x reduction** in the number of topics sent.

The broker will appreciate this 👍
Data frames are still sent at a rate of 4 seconds.

## 3.2.0

## ⚡️ Enhancements

# 🚨  Alarm management  🚨

Management of the 23 alarms that JK-BMS can trigger.
See DOCS.md file for more information

The module will create sensors automatically in HAOS.
These are:

* ❶ `binary\\\_sensor.bms\\\_x\\\_bms\\\_alarm\\\_active`
* ❷ `sensor.bms\\\_1\\\_bms\\\_1\\\_alarm\\\_list`

These 2 sensors indicate on which BMS there is an alarm and the wording of these alarms. If there is more than one, they are separated by a comma.

A global sensor:

* ❸ `binary\\\_sensor.bms\\\_global\\\_bms\\\_global\\\_alarm`
This is a binary sensor that enables simple automation in the event of an alarm on any BMS.

It was a big, long job, but I think it was worth it.
You tell me.

You can see a short live demonstration on my Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@domosimple)

## 3.1.2

🐞 Bug fixes --> Incorrect min / max ranges for MQTT number entities

[Issue #29](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/29)

All Home Assistant entities now have appropriate scales.

### 📌 For this to be taken into account !!!

it is **essential to Delete the MQTT device** `BMS\\\_1, BMS\\\_2, BMS\\\_3, etc.`

So that the entities can be recreated with the correct value scales



## 3.1.1

🐞 Bug fixes

Changed base image amd64 home assistant addon from 'stable' to '18.1.0'.
due to a change in the 'stable' image



## 3.1

## ⚡️ Enhancements

## 🌟  Cloud MQTT Broker support  🌟

Enable secure, encrypted transmission of user-defined JK-BMS entities to a cloud broker such as HiveMQTT.

As a result, this data can be accessed anywhere in the world and on any device that has an MQTT client installed.

For example, on your phone, the ["IoT MQTT Panel"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod&hl=en-US) application lets you connect to the Cloud Broker and display the JK-BMS values on your phone in a dashboard defined by you or downloaded from my Ko-Fi.

There's no need to install anything else at home, such as VPNs, proxies (Nginx) or personal plug\&play networks like Zerotier or Tailscale.

## To select the entities you wish to export

use the "File editor" addon to modify the `configentities\\\_list.json` file

For a fuller description, You can read the [`HiveMQ-Access.md` ](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/HiveMQ-Access.md)on the Github

You can also watch the video explanation on my channel Youtube: [@domosimple](https://www.youtube.com/@domosimple)

As the format has changed. You will then need to fill it in again ‼️ ‼️

## 3.0.12

## ⚡️ Enhancements

It is now possible to have the debug option on both the rs485 port and the IP gateway.

⚠️ The `gateway\\\_debug` parameter no longer exists, replaced by `communication\\\_debug`

👀 Please, Don't forget to reset it to "false" once testing is complete. This could unnecessarily overload the module

so that the module can be installed

## 3.0.7

change a timer for the MQTT alive

## 3.0.6

## 🐞 Bug fixes

* Check that MQTT is communicating with the module
I have created a Topic in the MQTT broker to confirm that the module is able to talk to the broker at. This Topic is called **JK-BMS-RS485-CAN-module** and it must be equal to **"Online"**.
You can check this with MQTTExplorer

<img width="680" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca40210b-f563-45c8-a73f-43a67e05cb32" />



* Checking communication with the BMS:
To check that communication with the BMS is working properly, a log is created in the module's log file. Every 30 seconds you should be able to see this type of text

```
6 Aug 18:42:13 - \\\[warn] \\\[function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:42:43 - \\\[warn] \\\[function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
