Smartphoton JK-BMS is a professional Home Assistant add-on for monitoring, controlling and integrating JK-BMS battery management systems through **RS485**, **TCP/IP gateways** or **CAN Bus**.

It transforms Home Assistant into a complete battery monitoring and energy management platform, with MQTT Discovery, multi-BMS support, advanced diagnostics, alarm management and optional Premium dashboard generation.

---

## 🚀 Major Upgrade: Variable Cell Count Support (1S to 16S)

The add-on now supports battery packs with any cell count from **1S to 16S**.

> No more wrong cell delta values on non-16S packs.

### What this improves

- Correct support for 4S, 8S, 15S, 16S and other supported pack sizes
- Accurate cell minimum, maximum, average and delta calculations
- Automatic exclusion of unused cell slots
- Better dashboard accuracy
- More reliable automations and diagnostics

### Why this matters

Until now, many users with non-16-cell battery packs could see incorrect cell statistics because unused cell slots were still present in the frame layout.

This feature makes the add-on cell-count aware, which is a major improvement for real-world battery installations.

---

---

## 🚀 Three Operating Modes

### 1️⃣ Master Mode

The add-on queries each BMS directly through RS485.

This mode provides full monitoring and full configuration access.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: false
```

Available features:

- Read live BMS data
- Modify BMS settings
- Monitor alarms
- Monitor cells
- Monitor temperatures
- Use full Home Assistant integration

---

### 2️⃣ Listening Mode

One BMS acts as the RS485 master.

The add-on listens to the RS485 traffic and publishes available data to Home Assistant.

This mode is ideal when an inverter requires one BMS to be the bus master.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: true
```

Available features:

- Read-only monitoring
- Multi-BMS data reception
- Home Assistant MQTT publishing
- Dashboard compatibility

---

### 3️⃣ CAN Bus Mode

CAN Bus mode uses the second RJ45 connector of compatible JK-BMS units.

This mode is designed for direct CAN Bus communication and autonomous broadcast operation.

## 💢 Important Safety Note

This add-on is designed for monitoring, automation and energy optimization.

It must not be the only safety layer of an electrical installation.

A failure of Home Assistant, Node-RED, MQTT, USB/RS485 communication, TCP/IP gateway communication or the host system should not be able, by itself, to create a critical power situation.

Please ensure your installation keeps safe fallback behavior, hardware protections and conservative default settings even if this add-on stops working or loses communication.

⚠️ See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for more details and recommended fail-safe design principles.

### USB Adapter Tip

Find your USB path in:

Home Assistant → Settings → System → Hardware → All Hardware

Look for a `ttyUSB` device.

Compatible adapters:

- FTDI
- CH340
- CP2102

Not recommended:

- Adapters creating `ttyACM0` interfaces

---

## 🌐 TCP/IP Gateway Support

You can connect your BMS remotely using an RS485 Ethernet or WiFi gateway in transparent mode.

This is useful when:

- The Home Assistant server is far from the batteries
- USB cabling is not practical
- Multiple installations need remote access
- The BMS cabinet is in another room or building

✅ Tested gateways are documented here:

[View compatible gateway models](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/tree/main/images/Modbus-Gateway)

---

## 🚨 Advanced Alarm Management

The add-on monitors 21 alarm types.

Examples include:

- Battery overvoltage
- Battery undervoltage
- Cell overvoltage
- Cell undervoltage
- Charge overcurrent
- Discharge overcurrent
- Overtemperature
- Undertemperature
- Cell imbalance
- Communication problems

### Home Assistant Alarm Entities

The add-on creates dedicated alarm entities:

- Active alarm count
- Alarm details
- Affected BMS identification
- Global binary sensor for automation triggers

📋 [Complete alarm reference table](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/Documentation/Alarmes-description.md)

Alarm management is currently available in Master mode. Broadcasting and CAN alarm support are planned.

---

## 📊 Home Assistant Integration

The add-on reads the real cell count reported by the BMS and adjusts cell analysis accordingly.

This means:

- No more incorrect cell delta values on non-16S packs
- Correct min, max and average calculations
- Correct support for 4S, 8S, 15S and 16S packs
- Better accuracy for dashboards, diagnostics and automations

---
